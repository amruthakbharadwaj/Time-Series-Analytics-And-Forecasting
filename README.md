Time Series Analytics and Forecasting For Net Electricity Generation in the USA:

Goal of the project is to analyze net electricity generation in the USA time series dataset and to forecast net electricity generation for the next 12 months. Various time series models like moving averages, simple exponential smoothing, advanced exponential smoothing, regression models, auto-regressive models (ARIMA) are used.

The dataset was obtained from the U.S Energy Information Administration (eia) website. This data has the information related to the net electricity generation from all the energy sources in the USA.

The dataset comprises of net electricity generation values from Jan 2001 to April 2020. This approximates to 19.4 years of monthly data which is 232 data periods.
